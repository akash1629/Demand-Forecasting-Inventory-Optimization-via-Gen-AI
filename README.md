# Generative AI–Driven Demand Forecasting & Inventory Optimization

This project demonstrates how to combine **classical time-series models** (ARIMA, Prophet) with **Generative AI** (mock GPT-based feature engineering) for more accurate **demand forecasting**. It also implements a **linear programming** approach to **inventory optimization** using [PuLP](https://coin-or.github.io/pulp/) to minimize holding costs and stockouts.

## Overview

- **Forecasting Models**: ARIMA and Prophet for time-series prediction.
- **Generative AI**: Demonstrates a **mock GPT** factor for advanced feature engineering (e.g., external signals, sentiment).
- **Inventory Optimization**: Uses linear programming (via PuLP) to determine optimal reorder points/quantities, minimizing costs.
- **Objective**: Reduce forecast error by leveraging both classical and modern AI techniques, and **trim inventory holding costs** while minimizing **stockouts**.

### Goals
1. **Improve Forecast Accuracy**  
   - Target an ~18% reduction in forecasting error.  
2. **Cut Stockouts & Holding Costs**  
   - Reduce stockouts by ~22% and holding costs by ~15%.  
3. **Cross-Functional Impact**  
   - Potential annual savings of **INR 2.8 million** (illustrative metric).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone or download** the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/ForecastingInventoryAI.git
   cd ForecastingInventoryAI
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run Jupyter Notebooks** for forecasting (ARIMA, Prophet) or the `inventory_lp.py` script for optimization.

## Key Features

1. **Time-Series Forecasting**  
   - ARIMA and Prophet for short-/long-term predictions.  
2. **Generative AI Factor**  
   - Mock GPT-based external signals (e.g., promotions, sentiment).  
3. **Inventory Optimization**  
   - PuLP-based linear programming to minimize stockouts and holding costs.  
4. **Cross-Functional Planning**  
   - Integrates supply chain, finance, and sales data.  
5. **Automated Reporting**  
   - Notebooks produce charts, error metrics, and optimization summaries.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**  
   - Place raw data in `data/raw/`.  
   - Run `scripts/data_cleaning.py` and `scripts/feature_engineering.py` (optional).  
2. **Forecasting**  
   - `01_ARIMA.ipynb` → classical ARIMA.  
   - `02_Prophet.ipynb` → Prophet approach.  
   - `03_GPT_Features.ipynb` → Illustrates mock GPT usage.  
3. **Optimization**  
   - Run `inventory_lp.py` in `optimization/` to solve for optimal reorder levels.  
4. **Evaluation**  
   - Compare MAPE/RMSE across ARIMA vs. Prophet, see cost reductions from the LP solution.
