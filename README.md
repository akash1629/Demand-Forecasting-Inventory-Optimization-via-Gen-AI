# Generative AIâ€“Driven Demand Forecasting & Inventory Optimization

This project demonstrates how to combine **traditional time-series models** (ARIMA, Prophet) with **Generative AI features** (mock GPT-based factor) for more accurate **demand forecasting**. It also implements a **linear programming** approach to **inventory optimization** using [PuLP](https://coin-or.github.io/pulp/) to minimize holding costs and stockouts.

## Overview

- **Forecasting Models**: ARIMA and Prophet for time-series forecasting.
- **Generative AI**: Demonstrates a mock GPT factor for advanced feature engineering.
- **Inventory Optimization**: A linear programming module that calculates optimal inventory levels.
- **Objective**: Reduce forecast error by leveraging both classical and modern AI techniques, and **trim inventory holding costs** while minimizing **stockout events**.

### Goals

1. **Improve forecast accuracy** (targeting an 18% reduction in errors).
2. **Reduce stockouts by 22%** and **holding costs by 15%** using LP-based optimization.
3. **Integrate cross-functional** (Supply Chain, Finance, Sales) planning to save **INR 2.8 million** annually (illustrative metric).
