# Generative AI–Driven Demand Forecasting & Inventory Optimization

This project combines **classical time-series models** (ARIMA, Prophet) with **Generative AI** (a mock GPT-based feature engineering module) to improve **demand forecasting** accuracy. Additionally, it applies a **linear programming** approach using [PuLP](https://coin-or.github.io/pulp/) for **inventory optimization**, aiming to reduce holding costs and prevent stockouts.

## Overview

- **Forecasting Models**: Implements ARIMA and Prophet for robust time-series prediction.
- **Generative AI**: Integrates a mock GPT module to generate advanced features from external signals (e.g., promotions, sentiment).
- **Inventory Optimization**: Utilizes PuLP-based linear programming to determine optimal reorder points and quantities, reducing overall costs.
- **Project Objective**: Decrease forecast errors while lowering inventory holding costs and minimizing stockouts.

### Goals

1. **Improve Forecast Accuracy**  
   - Achieve an approximate 18% reduction in forecasting error.
2. **Reduce Stockouts & Holding Costs**  
   - Target a 22% reduction in stockouts and a 15% reduction in holding costs.
3. **Cross-Functional Benefits**  
   - Demonstrate potential annual savings of **INR 2.8 million** (illustrative metric).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/ForecastingInventoryAI.git
   cd ForecastingInventoryAI
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Key Features

- **Time-Series Forecasting**  
  Uses ARIMA and Prophet to deliver both short- and long-term demand predictions.
- **Generative AI Integration**  
  Incorporates a mock GPT module to enrich feature sets with external signals such as promotional data and sentiment analysis.
- **Inventory Optimization**  
  Applies linear programming (via PuLP) to optimize reorder points and quantities, effectively reducing stockouts and holding costs.
- **Cross-Functional Planning**  
  Integrates data across supply chain, finance, and sales for comprehensive decision support.
- **Automated Reporting**  
  Generates detailed reports with charts, error metrics, and optimization results using interactive notebooks.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**  
   - Store your raw datasets in the `data/raw/` directory.
   - Optionally, run `scripts/data_cleaning.py` and `scripts/feature_engineering.py` to preprocess and enrich your data.
2. **Forecasting**  
   - Open `notebooks/01_ARIMA.ipynb` to explore the ARIMA-based forecasting approach.
   - Open `notebooks/02_Prophet.ipynb` for the Prophet-based model.
   - Review `notebooks/03_GPT_Features.ipynb` to see how the mock GPT module enhances feature engineering.
3. **Optimization**  
   - Run `optimization/inventory_lp.py` to compute the optimal reorder levels and quantities using linear programming.
4. **Evaluation**  
   - Compare performance metrics (e.g., MAPE, RMSE) between ARIMA and Prophet.
   - Assess cost reductions and stockout minimization achieved through the LP solution.
